# React FEH

This project was originally a React practice and a tool for me playing Fire Emblem Heroes. Since I had a SLOW start I had to rely on some tricks and datas that others already create.

Namely, thanks to:
- [FEH-STUFF](https://feh-stuff.github.io)
- [Fire Emblem Heroes Wiki](https://feheroes.gamepedia.com/Main_Page)

And of course Nintendo and Intelligent Systems, FEH is a awesome mobile game.
